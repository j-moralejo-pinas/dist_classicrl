* **Testing**: Edge cases, integration tests, performance benchmarks

Development Setup
=================

Environment Setup
-----------------

1. **Fork and Clone**

   Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dist_classicrl.git
       cd dist_classicrl

2. **Create Virtual Environment**

   We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Using venv
       python -m venv dist_classicrl_env
       source dist_classicrl_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: dist_classicrl_env\Scripts\activate

       # OR using conda
       conda create -n dist_classicrl python=3.9
       conda activate dist_classicrl

3. **Install Development Dependencies**

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -e ".[dev]"

   This installs the package in editable mode with all development dependencies:

   * ``pytest`` and ``pytest-cov`` for testing
   * ``pre-commit`` for code quality hooks
   * ``ruff`` for linting and formatting
   * ``pyright`` for type checking
   * ``sphinx`` for documentation

4. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**

   .. code-block:: bash

       pre-commit install

   This automatically runs code quality checks before each commit, including:

   * Code formatting with ``ruff``
   * Import sorting
   * Type checking with ``pyright``
   * Documentation linting

MPI Development (Optional)
--------------------------

For working on distributed training features, install MPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev
    pip install mpi4py

    # macOS
    brew install open-mpi
    pip install mpi4py

    # Test MPI installation
    mpirun -n 2 python -c "from mpi4py import MPI; print(f'Rank {MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank()}')"

Project Architecture
====================

Understanding the codebase structure will help you contribute effectively:

**Core Components:**

* ``src/dist_classicrl/algorithms/``

  * ``base_algorithms/``: Core Q-Learning implementations with different optimizations
  * ``runtime/``: Execution strategies (single-thread, parallel, distributed)
  * ``buffers/``: Experience replay (future expansion)

* ``src/dist_classicrl/environments/``

  * ``custom_env.py``: Abstract base for custom environments
  * ``tiktaktoe_mod.py``: Example environment for testing

* ``src/dist_classicrl/wrappers/``: Environment adapters and transformations
* ``src/dist_classicrl/utils.py``: Utility functions for action space handling

**Design Principles:**

1. **Modularity**: Each algorithm and execution mode is self-contained
2. **Performance**: Vectorized operations preferred over loops where possible
3. **Scalability**: Support for single-thread to distributed execution
4. **Standards Compliance**: Compatible with Gymnasium and PettingZoo
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new algorithms and environments

Development Workflow
====================

1. **Create a Feature Branch**

   .. code-block:: bash

       git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
       # or
       git checkout -b bugfix/issue-123

2. **Make Your Changes**

   * Write clear, documented code
   * Follow existing code style and patterns
   * Add type hints where appropriate
   * Update docstrings for public APIs

3. **Write Tests**

   * Add unit tests for new functionality
   * Update existing tests if needed
   * Ensure good test coverage
   * Test both single-threaded and parallel modes when applicable

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Run tests locally
       pytest tests/

       # Run specific test categories
       pytest tests/dist_classicrl/algorithms/
       pytest tests/dist_classicrl/environments/

       # Run with coverage
       pytest --cov=dist_classicrl tests/

4. **Test MPI Features (if applicable)**

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Run MPI tests
       mpirun -n 3 python -m pytest tests/dist_classicrl/algorithms/runtime/test_q_learning_async_dist.py::TestDistAsyncQLearningMPI

       # Or use the test runner
       bash tests/dist_classicrl/algorithms/runtime/run_runtime_tests.sh

5. **Run Performance Benchmarks**

   If you've modified core algorithms, run performance tests:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd dev_tests
       python perf_test.py

6. **Check Code Quality**

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Pre-commit will run automatically, but you can run manually:
       pre-commit run --all-files

       # Or run individual tools:
       ruff check src/ tests/
       ruff format src/ tests/
       pyright src/

7. **Update Documentation**

   * Update docstrings for new functions/classes
   * Add examples to the main documentation if needed
   * Update README.rst if adding major features

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Build docs locally
       cd docs
       make html
       # Open docs/_build/html/index.html

8. **Commit Your Changes**

   Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git add .
       git commit -m "feat: add SARSA algorithm implementation

       - Implement SARSA with epsilon-greedy policy
       - Add comprehensive unit tests
       - Update documentation with usage examples
       - Benchmark performance vs Q-Learning"

9. **Push and Create Pull Request**

   .. code-block:: bash

       git push origin feature/descriptive-name

   Then create a pull request on GitHub with:

   * Clear description of changes
   * Link to relevant issues
   * Screenshots/examples if applicable
   * Mention any breaking changes
--------------------

#. Create an user account on |the repository service| if you do not already have one.
#. Fork the project repository_: click on the *Fork* button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on |the repository service|.
#. Clone this copy to your local disk::

    git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/dist_classicrl.git
    cd dist_classicrl

#. You should run::

    pip install -U pip setuptools -e .

   to be able to import the package under development in the Python REPL.

   .. todo:: if you are not using pre-commit, please remove the following item:

#. Install |pre-commit|_::

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install

   ``dist_classicrl`` comes with a lot of hooks configured to automatically help the
   developer to check the code being written.

Implement your changes
----------------------

#. Create a branch to hold your changes::

    git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work on the main branch!

#. Start your work on this branch. Don't forget to add docstrings_ to new
   functions, modules and classes, especially if they are part of public APIs.

#. Add yourself to the list of contributors in ``AUTHORS.rst``.

#. When you‚Äôre done editing, do::

    git add <MODIFIED FILES>
    git commit

   to record your changes in git_.

   .. todo:: if you are not using pre-commit, please remove the following item:

   Please make sure to see the validation messages from |pre-commit|_ and fix
   any eventual issues.
   This should automatically use flake8_/black_ to check/fix the code style
   in a way that is compatible with the project.

   .. important:: Don't forget to add unit tests and documentation in case your
      contribution adds an additional feature and is not just a bugfix.

      Moreover, writing a `descriptive commit message`_ is highly recommended.
      In case of doubt, you can check the commit history with::

         git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all

      to look for recurring communication patterns.

#. Please check that your changes don't break any unit tests with::

    tox

   (after having installed |tox|_ with ``pip install tox`` or ``pipx``).

   You can also use |tox|_ to run several other pre-configured tasks in the
   repository. Try ``tox -av`` to see a list of the available checks.

Submit your contribution
------------------------

#. If everything works fine, push your local branch to |the repository service| with::

    git push -u origin my-feature

#. Go to the web page of your fork and click |contribute button|
   to send your changes for review.

   .. todo:: if you are using GitHub, you can uncomment the following paragraph

      Find more detailed information in `creating a PR`_. You might also want to open
      the PR as a draft first and mark it as ready for review after the feedbacks
      from the continuous integration (CI) system or any required fixes.


Troubleshooting
---------------

The following tips can be used when facing problems to build or test the
package:

#. Make sure to fetch all the tags from the upstream repository_.
   The command ``git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`` should return the version you
   are expecting. If you are trying to run CI scripts in a fork repository,
   make sure to push all the tags.
   You can also try to remove all the egg files or the complete egg folder, i.e.,
   ``.eggs``, as well as the ``*.egg-info`` folders in the ``src`` folder or
   potentially in the root of your project.

#. Sometimes |tox|_ misses out when new dependencies are added, especially to
   ``setup.cfg`` and ``docs/requirements.txt``. If you find any problems with
   missing dependencies when running a command with |tox|_, try to recreate the
   ``tox`` environment using the ``-r`` flag. For example, instead of::

    tox -e docs

   Try running::

    tox -r -e docs

#. Make sure to have a reliable |tox|_ installation that uses the correct
   Python version (e.g., 3.7+). When in doubt you can run::

    tox --version
    # OR
    which tox

   If you have trouble and are seeing weird errors upon running |tox|_, you can
   also try to create a dedicated `virtual environment`_ with a |tox|_ binary
   freshly installed. For example::

    virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    .venv/bin/pip install tox
    .venv/bin/tox -e all

#. `Pytest can drop you`_ in an interactive session in the case an error occurs.
   In order to do that you need to pass a ``--pdb`` option (for example by
   running ``tox -- -k <NAME OF THE FALLING TEST> --pdb``).
   You can also setup breakpoints manually instead of using the ``--pdb`` option.


**Release Process:**

For maintainers with PyPI access, follow these steps to release a new version:

1. **Prepare Release**

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Ensure all tests pass
       pytest tests/
       bash tests/dist_classicrl/algorithms/runtime/run_runtime_tests.sh

       # Update version and changelog
       # Version is managed by setuptools_scm automatically

2. **Create Release Tag**

   .. code-block:: bash

       git tag v1.2.3
       git push origin v1.2.3

3. **Build and Upload**

   .. code-block:: bash

       # Clean previous builds
       rm -rf dist/ build/

       # Build distribution
       python -m build

       # Upload to PyPI (requires API token)
       python -m twine upload dist/*

**Code Review Process:**

* All changes require review by at least one maintainer
* Focus on code quality, performance impact, and maintainability
* Ensure comprehensive test coverage
* Verify documentation is updated

**Issue Triage:**

* Label issues appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
* Assign priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
* Link related issues and pull requests
* Close stale issues after warning period
